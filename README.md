## Example Usage
For the input string "huffman coding", the encoded output might look something like:

> Encoded: 1101110100111001100011011110000111100001000110

> Decoded: huffman coding

Huffman coding is efficient when there are various characters with varying frequencies in the input data, making it an effective compression algorithm.
